## Personal Files Repository


Hi My name is Oliver! This is a repo where I keep the raw LaTeX code for my CV.

Additionally, I also currently keep some of my past research publications here. My previous work involved application of rigorous quantitative methods in environmental economics, operations research, and impact analysis of environment policy.
